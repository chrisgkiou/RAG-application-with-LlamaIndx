# RAG-application-with-LlamaIndx


A RAG application utilizing Llama2 and the LlamaIndex framework demonstrates how to build an efficient retrieval system with an open-source large language model. LlamaIndex provides a simple, flexible data framework for connecting custom data sources to LLMs, playing a key role in the retrieval process for a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) system. In this implementation, weâ€™ll showcase how LlamaIndex enhances data retrieval in a real-world RAG application using Llama2, though the core architecture remains largely the same when applied to paid LLMs, such as OpenAI's models.
